Buenos handout for OSM exam 2015, version 1.0
=============================================

This Buenos version supports TTY interaction, user processes, user semaphores,
TLB handling, and file I/O, as well as `syscall_fork`.

The `tests` directory contains a fair amount of tests for this Buenos handout.
You are not required to understand these tests.  If you wish to run all of them,
you may have to create a harddisk with more than the typical 2048 blocks.
